### Capstone 1

Now that you have completed the Foundation training modules, the next step in your RPA education program is to start working on some real-life processes in which you have to utilize the full extent of your newly acquired RPA skills.

To facilitate this, we have designed a dedicated training environment to be used throughout this advanced course.

The background story of the process you’re about to start is as follows: YOU work for a financial institution called ACME Systems Inc. You are in charge with automating most of the back-office processes. The Business Department of the organization has already selected the processes  to be included in this Pilot RPA Implementation – and albeit some might not be necessarily the best choices in terms of Development time versus Time Saved – Business is Business, so the decision cannot be argued with.

The main application used throughout the course is ACME System 1 – our internal web app that is useful in many endeavors and scenarios.  The pending work, or the task list, is well structured in the Work Items section. Ideally, all users should process all the available entries in the Work Items list.  However, the items in the list are not to be operated on manually. Instead, we will create Robots to handle the work for us!

*** Instructions

To easily complete the processes we have designed, you should consider the following instructions:

You need a user account on the ACME System 1 web app. Go to http://www.acme-test.com and register today! 

The first step you need to perform upon your very first successful login is to access the User Options section and click the Reset Test Data button. A full set of test data for your user account is generated. It includes vendors, invoices, reports, clients, checks, accounts, etc.

Feel free to reuse the above option at any point if you want to erase all the existing  data in your account and generate a new set. This is particularly useful in the development stage, because Work Items are marked as completed as soon as they are processed. Note: Do not reset the test data if the results of your evaluation on one of the assignments are still pending!

Naturally, you may change your Password, or recover it using the Forgot Password functionality.
